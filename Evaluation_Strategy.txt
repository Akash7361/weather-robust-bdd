Evaluation Strategy

- Metrics: Use mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 to evaluate detection accuracy and localization quality.
- Validation: Evaluate on clear-weather validation data to establish a stable baseline.
- Testing: Test on mixed/adverse-weather data to measure generalization and domain shift.
- Training setup: Train for a fixed number of epochs and batch size to ensure stable convergence.
- Initialization: Use COCO-pretrained YOLOv8 weights for faster and more reliable training.
- Analysis: Use precision–recall curves to analyze confidence behavior and class-wise performance.
